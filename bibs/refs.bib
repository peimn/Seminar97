abstract = {Advancements in intelligent transportation systems and communication technology could considerably reduce delay and congestion through an array of networkwide traffic control and management strategies. The two most promising control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and dynamic traffic diversion using variable message signs (VMSs). The use of these control methods independently could limit their usefulness. Therefore, integrated corridor control by using ramp metering and VMS diversion simultaneously could be beneficial. Administration of freeways and adjacent arterials often falls under different jurisdictional authorities. Lack of coordination among those authorities caused by lack of means for information exchange or "institutional gridlock" could hinder the full potential of technically possible integrated control. Fully automating corridor control could alleviate this problem. Research was conducted to develop a self-learning adaptive integrated freeway-arterial corridor control for both recurring and nonrecurring congestion. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence method for machine learning, is used to provide a single, multiple, or integrated optimal control agent for a freeway or freeway-arterial corridor for both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion. The microsimulation tool Paramics, which has been used to train and evaluate the agent in an offline mode within a simulated environment, is described. Results from various simulation case studies in the Toronto, Canada, area are encouraging and have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the technique.},

abstract = {Real-time traffic signal control is an integral part of the urban traffic control system, and providing effective real-time traffic signal control for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised traffic responsive signal control models, where each agent in the system is a local traffic signal controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time traffic signal control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based traffic signal controllers are implemented into the traffic network.Acomprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent sys- tem provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing traffic signal control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78{\%} and the mean stoppage time, by 85{\%} compared to the existing traffic signal control algorithm. The promising results demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid NN-based multiagent system in solving large-scale traffic signal control problems in a distributed manner.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-agent system based on type-2 fuzzy decision module for traffic signal control in a complex urban road network. The distributed agent architecture using type-2 fuzzy set based controller was designed for optimizing green time in a traffic signal to reduce the total delay experienced by vehicles. A section of the Central Business District of Singapore simulated using PARAMICS software was used as a test bed for validating the proposed agent architecture for the signal control. The performance of the proposed multi-agent controller was compared with a hybrid neural network based hierarchical multi-agent system (HMS) controller and real-time adaptive traffic controller (GLIDE) currently used in Singapore. The performance metrics used for evaluation were total mean delay experienced by the vehicles to travel from source to destination and the current mean speed of vehicles inside the road network. The proposed multi-agent signal control was found to produce a significant improvement in the traffic conditions of the road network reducing the total travel time experienced by vehicles simulated under dual and multiple peak traffic scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Srinivasan2003,
abstract = {This paper presents a new hybrid, synergistic approach in applying computational intelligence concepts to implement a cooperative, hierarchical, multiagent system for real-time traffic signal control of a complex traffic network. The large-scale traffic signal control problem is divided into various subproblems, and each subproblem is handled by an intelligent agent with a fuzzy neural decision-making module. The decisions made by lower-level agents are mediated by their respective higher-level agents. Through adopting a cooperative distributed problem solving approach, coordinated control by the agents is achieved. In order for the multiagent architecture to adapt itself continuously to the dynamically changing problem domain, a multistage online learning process for each agent is implemented involving reinforcement learning, learning rate and weight adjustment as well as dynamic update of fuzzy relations using an evolutionary algorithm. The test bed used for this research is a section of the Central Business District of Singapore. The performance of the proposed multiagent architecture is evaluated against the set of signal plans used by the current real-time adaptive traffic control system. The multiagent architecture produces significant improvements in the conditions of the traffic network, reducing the total mean delay by 40{\%} and total vehicle stoppage time by 50{\%}.},

@article{Smith2013,
abstract = {In this paper, we describe a pilot implementation and field test of a recently developed approach to real-time adaptive traffic signal control. The pilot system, called SURTRAC (Scalable Urban Traffic Control), follows the perspective of recent work in multi-agent planning and implements a decentralized, schedule-driven approach to traffic signal control. Under this approach, each intersection independently (and asynchronously) computes a schedule that optimizes the flow of currently approaching traffic through that intersection, and uses this schedule to decide when to switch green phases. The traffic outflows projected by this schedule are then communicated to the intersection's downstream neighbors, to increase visibility of vehicles entering their respective planning horizons. This process is repeated as frequently as once per second in rolling horizon fashion, to provide real-time responsiveness to changing traffic conditions and coordinated signal network behavior. After summarizing this basic approach to adaptive traffic signal control and the domain challenges it is intended to address, we describe the pilot implementation of SURTRAC and its application to a nine-intersection road network in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both the SURTRAC architecture for interfacing with the detection equipment, hardware controller and communication network at a given intersection and the extensions required to account for unreliable sensor data are discussed. Finally, we present the results of a pilot test of the system, where SURTRAC is seen to achieve major reductions in travel times and vehicle emissions over pre-existing signal timings.

The available information on VSL impact on aggregate traffic flow behavior is summarized, and the issue is investigated in more detail with real traffic data from a European motorway. It is found that VSLs decrease the slope of the flow-occupancy diagram at undercritical conditions, shift the critical occupancy to higher values, and enable higher flows at the same occupancy values in overcritical conditions. Implications of the derived findings for more efficient VSL control strategies are discussed.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the number of vehicles has increased exponentially, but the bedrock capacities of roads and transportation systems have not developed in an equivalent way to efficiently cope with the number of vehicles traveling on them. Due to this, road jamming and traffic correlated pollution have increased with the associated adverse societal and financial effect on different markets worldwide. A static control system may block emergency vehicles due to traffic jams. Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs) have gained increasing attention in traffic detection and avoiding road congestion. WSNs are very trendy due to their faster transfer of information, easy installation, less maintenance, compactness and for being less expensive compared to other network options. There has been significant research on Traffic Management Systems using WSNs to avoid congestion, ensure priority for emergency vehicles and cut the AverageWaiting Time (AWT) of vehicles at intersections. In recent decades, researchers have started to monitor real-time traffic using WSNs, RFIDs, ZigBee, VANETs, Bluetooth devices, cameras and infrared signals. This paper presents a survey of current urban traffic management schemes for priority-based signalling, and reducing congestion and the AWT of vehicles. The main objective of this survey is to provide a taxonomy of different traffic management schemes used for avoiding congestion. Existing urban traffic management schemes for the avoidance of congestion and providing priority to emergency vehicles are considered and set the foundation for further research.},

abstract = {Integrated variable speed limit and ramp metering control for highway traffic is expected to smooth the traffic flow and improve the mobility of highway networks. Our recent results showed that variable speed limit control alone cannot eliminate capacity drops in many incident cases, where one or more lanes are closed due to microscopic phenomena such as forced lane changes and merging dynamics. In this paper, we developed a coordinated variable speed limit, ramp metering and lane change control which guarantees stability of the traffic flow and improves traffic mobility, safety and the environment. In the proposed control strategy, while the lane change control avoids the capacity drop, a feedback linearization variable speed limit controller coordinates with the ramp metering and stabilizes the bottleneck flow at the maximum level. Microscopic Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate significant improvement on traffic mobility, safety and environment by using the proposed controller.},

Deep learning, with the recent breakthrough in the machine learning/intelligence area, appears to be a viable approach for the network operators to configure and manage their networks in a more intelligent and autonomous fashion. While deep learning has received a significant research attention in a number of other domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, robotics, and so forth, its applications in network traffic control systems are relatively recent and garnered rather little attention. In this paper, we address this point and indicate the necessity of surveying the scattered works on deep learning applications for various network traffic control aspects. In this vein, we provide an overview of the state-ofthe- art deep learning architectures and algorithms relevant to the network traffic control systems. Also, we discuss the deep learning enablers for network systems. In addition, we discuss, in detail, a new use case, i.e., deep learning based intelligent routing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the deep learning based routing approach in contrast with the conventional routing strategy. Furthermore, we discuss a number of open research issues, which researchers may find useful in the future.},

abstract = {The ability to exert real-time, adaptive control of transportation processes is the core of many intelligent transportation systems decision support tools. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence approach undergoing development in the machine-learning community, offers key advantages in this regard. The ability of a control agent to learn relationships between control actions and their effect on the environment while pursuing a goal is a distinct improvement over prespecified models of the environment. Prespecified models are a prerequisite of conventional control methods and their accuracy limits the performance of control agents.

abstract = {Traffic congestion is an ever increasing problem on our roadways and city streets. The main contribution of this survey is a taxonomy of adaptive traffic signal control strategies achieved through various levels of vehicular communications.Strategies to optimize traffic signals fall into three categories based on the level of vehicle involvement. The first category involves those strategies that utilize legacy devices with no vehicular involvement. The second category comprises those strategies that utilize vehicles on the road to wirelessly transmit data about themselves (e.g. location, velocity). The third category involves strategies that utilize the vehicles' on-board computation power to help optimize traffic signals. The bulk of this survey deals with the second category as it appears to be the most prevalent in the research literature. We are however, quick to point out that the third category seems to be gaining momentum, as the prevalence of smartphones has suggested supplementing legacy traffic monitoring with traffic-related reports submitted by the driving public.},

@article{Khamis2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we focus on computing a consistent traffic signal configuration at each junction that optimizes multiple performance indices, i.e.; multi-objective traffic signal control. The multi-objective function includes minimizing trip waiting time, total trip time, and junction waiting time. Moreover, the multi-objective function includes maximizing flow rate, satisfying green waves for platoons traveling in main roads, avoiding accidents especially in residential areas, and forcing vehicles to move within moderate speed range of minimum fuel consumption. In particular, we formulate our multi-objective traffic signal control as a multi-agent system (MAS). Traffic signal controllers have a distributed nature in which each traffic signal agent acts individually and possibly cooperatively in a MAS. In addition, agents act autonomously according to the current traffic situation without any human intervention. Thus, we develop a multi-agent multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) traffic signal control framework that simulates the driver's behavior (acceleration/deceleration) continuously in space and time dimensions. The proposed framework is based on a multi-objective sequential decision making process whose parameters are estimated based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability. Using this interpretation together with a novel adaptive cooperative exploration technique, the proposed traffic signal controller can make real-time adaptation in the sense that it responds effectively to the changing road dynamics. These road dynamics are simulated by the Green Light District (GLD) vehicle traffic simulator that is the testbed of our traffic signal control. We have implemented the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) acceleration model in the GLD traffic simulator. The change in road conditions is modeled by varying the traffic demand probability distribution and adapting the IDM parameters to the adverse weather conditions. Under the congested and free traffic situations, the proposed multi-objective controller significantly outperforms the underlying single objective controller which only minimizes the trip waiting time (i.e.; the total waiting time in the whole vehicle trip rather than at a specific junction). For instance, the average trip and waiting times are ≃ 8 and 6 times lower respectively when using the multi-objective controller. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.},

abstract = {Information from connected vehicles, such as the position and speed of individual vehicles, can be used to optimize traffic operations at an intersection. This paper proposes such an algorithm for two one-way-streets assuming that only a certain percentage of cars are equipped with this technology. The algorithm enumerates different sequences of cars discharging from the intersection to minimize the objective function. Benefits of platooning (multiple cars consecutively discharging from a queue) and signal flexibility (adaptability to demand) are also considered. The goal is to gain insights about the value (in terms of delay savings) of using connected vehicle technology for intersection control.Simulations are conducted for different total demand values and demand ratios to understand the effects of changing the minimum green time at the signal and the penetration rate of connected cars. Using autonomous vehicle control systems, the signal could rapidly change the direction of priority without relying on the reaction of drivers. However, without this technology a minimum green time is necessary. The results of the simulations show that a minimum green time increases the delay only for the low and balanced demand scenarios. Therefore, the value of using cars with autonomous vehicle control can only be seen at intersections with this kind of demand patterns, and could result in up to 7{\%} decrease in delay. On the other hand, using information from connected vehicles to better adapt the traffic signal has proven to be indeed very valuable. Increases in the penetration rate from 0{\%} up to 60{\%} can significantly reduce the average delay (in low demand scenarios a decrease in delay of up to 60{\%} can be observed). That being said, after a penetration rate of 60{\%}, while the delays continue to decrease, the rate of reduction decreases and the marginal value of information from communication technologies diminishes. Overall, it is observed that connected vehicle technology could significantly improve the operation of traffic at signalized intersections, at least under the proposed algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Artificial intelligence methods have gained popularity for optimal traffic light control. In this paper, a review of most important works in the field of controlling traffic signal timing, in particular studies focusing on Q-learning, neural network, and fuzzy logic system are presented. As per existing literature, the intelligent methods show a higher performance compared to traditional controlling methods. However, a study that compares the performance of different learning methods is not published yet. In this paper, the aforementioned computational intelligence methods and a fixed-time method are implemented to set signals times and minimize total delays for an isolated intersection. These methods are developed and compared on a same platform. The intersection is treated as an intelligent agent that learns to propose an appropriate green time for each phase. The appropriate green time for all the intelligent controllers are estimated based on the received traffic information. A comprehensive comparison is made between the performance of Q-learning, neural network, and fuzzy logic system controller for two different scenarios. The three intelligent learning controllers present close performances with multiple replication orders in two scenarios. On average Q-learning has 66{\%}, neural network 71{\%}, and fuzzy logic has 74{\%} higher performance compared to the fixed-time controller.},

The current emphasis on the development of automated (i.e., driverless and with the ability to communicate with the infrastructure) vehicles brings at the forefront several questions related to the functionality and optimization of signal control in order to take advantage of automated vehicle capabilities. The objective of this research is to develop a signal control algorithm that allows for vehicle paths and signal control to be jointly optimized based on advanced communication technology between approaching vehicles and signal controller. The algorithm assumes that vehicle trajectories can be fully optimized, i.e., vehicles will follow the optimized paths specified by the signal controller. An optimization algorithm was developed assuming a simple intersection with two single-lane through approaches. A rolling horizon scheme was developed to implement the algorithm and to continually process newly arriving vehicles. The algorithm was coded in MATLAB and results were compared against traditional actuated signal control for a variety of demand scenarios. It was concluded that the proposed signal control optimization algorithm could reduce the ATTD by 16.2-36.9{\%} and increase throughput by 2.7-20.2{\%}, depending on the demand scenario.},

abstract = {The state of the practice traffic signal control strategies mainly rely on infrastructure based vehicle detector data as the input for the control logic. The infrastructure based detectors are generally point detectors which cannot directly provide measurement of vehicle location and speed. With the advances in wireless communication technology, vehicles are able to communicate with each other and with the infrastructure in the emerging connected vehicle system. Data collected from connected vehicles provides a much more complete picture of the traffic states near an intersection and can be utilized for signal control. This paper presents a real-time adaptive signal phase allocation algorithm using connected vehicle data. The proposed algorithm optimizes the phase sequence and duration by solving a two-level optimization problem. Two objective functions are considered: minimization of total vehicle delay and minimization of queue length. Due to the low penetration rate of the connected vehicles, an algorithm that estimates the states of unequipped vehicle based on connected vehicle data is developed to construct a complete arrival table for the phase allocation algorithm. A real-world intersection is modeled in VISSIM to validate the algorithms. Results with a variety of connected vehicle market penetration rates and demand levels are compared to well-tuned fully actuated control. In general, the proposed control algorithm outperforms actuated control by reducing total delay by as much as 16.33{\%} in a high penetration rate case and similar delay in a low penetration rate case. Different objective functions result in different behaviors of signal timing. The minimization of total vehicle delay usually generates lower total vehicle delay, while minimization of queue length serves all phases in a more balanced way.},

Traditional systems are not capable of adjusting the timing pattern in accordance with vehicular demand. This results in excessive delays for road users. Hence it is necessary to develop dynamic systems that can adjust the timing patterns according to traffic demand. In this paper, the design and implementation of an adaptive traffic signal control system based on car-to-car communication is presented. Also, a clustering algorithm is defined which will assist in estimating the density of vehicles approaching an intersection. The cycle time, which is calculated using the estimated density of vehicular traffic, helps in reducing both the waiting time for vehicles at intersections and queue length. It is also shown that the proposed solution is collision free at intersections. The proposed system is compared with a classic pre-timed system and an adaptive fuzzy logic system. The simulations also show that the data convergence time and the communication delay between vehicles and traffic signals do not compromise the efficiency of the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Previous research within the area of intelligent traffic signal control has several shortcomings, including a reliance on historical data, the use of centralized systems which cannot handle city-sized problem instances and solutions which are not capable of addressing real-world traffic scenarios (e.g.; constantly varying volumes and complex network structures). The research reported here proposes algorithms capable of controlling traffic signals that rely on traffic observations made by available sensor devices and local communication between traffic lights. This solution allows signals to be updated frequently to match current traffic demand, while also allowing for significantly large problem sizes to be addressed. To evaluate the developed system, a realistic traffic model was developed using information supplied by the City of Ottawa, Canada. It was found, through simulation within the SUMO traffic simulation environment, that the proposed adaptive system resulted in higher overall network performance when compared to the current fixed signal plan controllers, which were recreated using information from the City of Ottawa. This work also includes examples of why fixed signal controllers are inferior to an adaptive control system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In peak hours, when the limited transportation capacity of urban rail transit is not adequate enough to meet the travel demands, the density of the passengers waiting at the platform can exceed the critical density of the platform. Coordinated passenger inflow control strategy is required to adjust/meter the inflow volume and relieve some of the demand pressure at crowded metro stations so as to ensure both operational efficiency and safety at such stations for all passengers. However, such strategy is usually developed by the operation staff at each station based on their practical working experience. As such, the best strategy/decision cannot always be made and sometimes can even be highly undesirable due to their inability to account for the dynamic performance of all metro stations in the entire rail transit network. In this paper, a new reinforcement learning-based method is developed to optimize the inflow volume during a certain period of time at each station with the aim of minimizing the safety risks imposed on passengers at the metro stations. Basic principles and fundamental components of the reinforcement learning, as well as the reinforcement learning-based problem-specific algorithm are presented. The simulation experiment carried out on a real-world metro line in Shanghai is constructed to test the performance of the approach. Simulation results show that the reinforcement learning-based inflow volume control strategy is highly effective in minimizing the safety risks by reducing the frequency of passengers being stranded. Additionally, the strategy also helps to relieve the passenger congestion at certain stations.},

The integrated controller remains simple yet efficient and suitable for field implementation.

@article{Jin2015,
abstract = {Group-based signal control is one of the most prevalent control schemes in the European countries. The major advantage of group-based control is its capability in providing flexible phase structures. The current group-based control systems are usually implemented with rather simple timing logics, e.g. vehicle actuated logic. However, such a timing logic is not sufficient to respond to the traffic environment whose inputs, i.e. traffic demands, dynamically change over time. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to formulate the existing group-based signal controller as a multi-agent system. The proposed signal control system is capable of making intelligent timing decisions by utilizing machine learning techniques. In this regard, reinforcement learning is a potential solution because of its self-learning properties in a dynamic environment. This paper, thus, proposes an adaptive signal control system, enabled by a reinforcement learning algorithm, in the context of group-based phasing technique. Two different learning algorithms, Q-learning and SARSA, have been investigated and tested on a four-legged intersection. The experiments are carried out by means of an open-source traffic simulation tool, SUMO. Performances on traffic mobility of the adaptive group- based signal control systems are compared against those of a well-established group-based fixed time control system. In the testbed experiments, simulation results reveal that the learning-based adaptive signal controller outperforms group-based fixed time signal controller with regards to the improvements in traffic mobility efficiency. In addition, SARSA learning is a more suitable implementation for the proposed adaptive group-based signal control system compared to the Q-learning approach.},

abstract = {This paper develops a novel linear programming formulation for autonomous intersection control (LPAIC) accounting for traffic dynamics within a connected vehicle environment. Firstly, a lane based bi-level optimization model is introduced to propagate traffic flows in the network, accounting for dynamic departure time, dynamic route choice, and autonomous intersection control in the context of system optimum network model. Then the bi-level optimization model is transformed to the linear programming formulation by relaxing the nonlinear constraints with a set of linear inequalities. One special feature of the LPAIC formulation is that the entries of the constraint matrix has only {\{}-1,. 0,. 1{\}} values. Moreover, it is proved that the constraint matrix is totally unimodular, the optimal solution exists and contains only integer values. It is also shown that the traffic flows from different lanes pass through the conflict points of the intersection safely and there are no holding flows in the solution. Three numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the properties and effectiveness of the LPAIC formulation to solve autonomous intersection control.},

abstract = {The transportation demand is rapidly growing in metropolises, resulting in chronic traffic congestions in dense downtown areas. Adaptive traffic signal control as the principle part of intelligent transportation systems has a primary role to effectively reduce traffic congestion by making a real-time adaptation in response to the changing traffic network dynamics. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective approach in machine learning that has been applied for designing adaptive traffic signal controllers. One of the most efficient and robust type of RL algorithms are continuous state actor-critic algorithms that have the advantage of fast learning and the ability to generalize to new and unseen traffic conditions. These algorithms are utilized in this paper to design adaptive traffic signal controllers called actor-critic adaptive traffic signal controllers (A-CATs controllers). The contribution of the present work rests on the integration of three threads: (a) showing performance comparisons of both discrete and continuous A-CATs controllers in a traffic network with recurring congestion (24-h traffic demand) in the upper downtown core of Tehran city, (b) analyzing the effects of different traffic disruptions including opportunistic pedestrians crossing, parking lane, non-recurring congestion, and different levels of sensor noise on the performance of A-CATS controllers, and (c) comparing the performance of different function approximators (tile coding and radial basis function) on the learning of A-CATs controllers. To this end, first an agent-based traffic simulation of the study area is carried out. Then six different scenarios are conducted to find the best A-CATs controller that is robust enough against different traffic disruptions. We observe that the A-CATs controller based on radial basis function networks (RBF (5)) outperforms others. This controller is benchmarked against controllers of discrete state Q-learning, Bayesian Q-learning, fixed time and actuated controllers; and the results reveal that it consistently outperforms them.},

@article{Zheng2017,
abstract = {Recently connected vehicle (CV) technology has received significant attention thanks to active pilot deployments supported by the US Department of Transportation (USDOT). At signalized intersections, CVs may serve as mobile sensors, providing opportunities of reducing dependencies on conventional vehicle detectors for signal operation. However, most of the existing studies mainly focus on scenarios that penetration rates of CVs reach certain level, e.g., 25{\%}, which may not be feasible in the near future. How to utilize data from a small number of CVs to improve traffic signal operation remains an open question. In this work, we develop an approach to estimate traffic volume, a key input to many signal optimization algorithms, using GPS trajectory data from CV or navigation devices under low market penetration rates. To estimate traffic volumes, we model vehicle arrivals at signalized intersections as a time-dependent Poisson process, which can account for signal coordination. The estimation problem is formulated as a maximum likelihood problem given multiple observed trajectories from CVs approaching to the intersection. An expectation maximization (EM) procedure is derived to solve the estimation problem. Two case studies were conducted to validate our estimation algorithm. One uses the CV data from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project, in which around 2800 CVs were deployed in the City of Ann Arbor, MI. The other uses vehicle trajectory data from users of a commercial navigation service in China. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the estimation is found to be 9–12{\%}, based on benchmark data manually collected and data from loop detectors. Considering the existing scale of CV deployments, the proposed approach could be of significant help to traffic management agencies for evaluating and operating traffic signals, paving the way of using CVs for detector-free signal operation in the future.},

The goal of this paper is to analyze the feasibility of RL, particularly the use of Q-learning algorithm for adaptive traffic signal control in different traffic dynamics.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel dynamic speed limit control model accounting for uncertain traffic demand and supply in a stochastic traffic network. First, a link based dynamic network loading model is developed to simulate the traffic flow propagation allowing the change of speed limits. Shockwave propagation is well defined and captured by checking the difference between the queue forming end and the dissipation end. Second, the dynamic speed limit problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solved by a real time control mechanism. The speed limit controller is modeled as an intelligent agent interacting with the stochastic network environment stochastic network environment to assign time dependent link based speed limits. Based on different metrics, e.g. total network throughput, delay time, vehicular emissions are optimized in the modeling framework, the optimal speed limit scheme is obtained by applying the R-Markov Average Reward Technique (R-MART) based reinforcement learning algorithm. A case study of the Sioux Falls network is constructed to test the performance of the model. Results show that the total travel time and emissions (in terms of CO) are reduced by around 18{\%} and 20{\%} compared with the base case of non-speed limit control. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We develop a deep learning model to predict traffic flows. The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using ℓ1regularization and a sequence of tanh layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp nonlinearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions.},

@article{Jacob2006,
abstract = {Advancements in intelligent transportation systems and communication technology could considerably reduce delay and congestion through an array of networkwide traffic control and management strategies. The two most promising control tools for freeway corridors are traffic-responsive ramp metering and dynamic traffic diversion using variable message signs (VMSs). The use of these control methods independently could limit their usefulness. Therefore, integrated corridor control by using ramp metering and VMS diversion simultaneously could be beneficial. Administration of freeways and adjacent arterials often falls under different jurisdictional authorities. Lack of coordination among those authorities caused by lack of means for information exchange or "institutional gridlock" could hinder the full potential of technically possible integrated control. Fully automating corridor control could alleviate this problem. Research was conducted to develop a self-learning adaptive integrated freeway-arterial corridor control for both recurring and nonrecurring congestion. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence method for machine learning, is used to provide a single, multiple, or integrated optimal control agent for a freeway or freeway-arterial corridor for both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion. The microsimulation tool Paramics, which has been used to train and evaluate the agent in an offline mode within a simulated environment, is described. Results from various simulation case studies in the Toronto, Canada, area are encouraging and have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the technique.},

abstract = {This paper describes using multi-agent rein-forcement learning (RL) algorithms for learn-ing tra{\AE}c light controllers to minimize the overall waiting time of cars in a city. The RL systems learn value functions estimating ex-pected waiting times for cars given dierent settings of tra{\AE}c lights. Selected settings of tra{\AE}c lights result from combining the pre-dicted waiting times of all cars involved. We investigate RL systems using dierent kinds of global communicated information between tra{\AE}c light agents. We also show how the value functions can be used by the driving policies of cars to select optimal routes to destination addresses. The experimental results show that the RL algorithms can outperform non-adaptable traffic light controllers, and that optimizing driving policies is very useful.},
