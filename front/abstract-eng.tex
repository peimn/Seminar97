Keep track of traffic flow benefits such as avoiding waste of time, saving fuel and preventing environmental pollution. Due to the constraints on highway development and its irrationality, different approaches are needed to improve traffic flow. Artificial Intelligence despite of recent advances, have been entered in all domains. Various algorithms have been developed to control traffic and improve its flow based on well-known algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning and Markov Decision Processes. 
%	The nature of Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning and reward performance Their punishment and improvement of their performance based on previous environment and factors make it an appropriate option Applying in the area of ​​improving traffic flow. Because cars and drivers are in need of it Encourage to improve the flow of traffic generated by their performance and subsequently punishment should be in case Bad performance applied to them. Also, due to the uncertainty of the environment, the algorithm is required every time Examine the environment and learn to improve its performance. Improve traffic flow to Two microscopic and macroscopic faces are modeled, one for each car and one for all cars Checked. The work done to control traffic is often to improve the performance of traffic lights and Driving or adopting appropriate speeds in different parts of the route. Some approaches are also a combination of these two Provide. Improving traffic flow in urban areas and outside the city requires different decisions It is appropriate to the environment and, in some cases, the combination of these two approaches (in the case of highway crossings with cities) has had better results.
